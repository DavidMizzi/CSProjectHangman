1...INTRODUCTION
----------------
Hangman ('the game') is a console run game developed in C# and which utilises .NET framework. 
The project was developed from self-taught programming knowledge in preparation for formal 
programming studies. With limited knowledge of Python and 4-weeks of C# study, Hangman is the 
outcome.

The game is based on the classic hangman game.



2...PROJECT SCOPE
-----------------
As a game, Hangman is limited to its intended purpose - an exercise which helps me to embed 
and enhance basic C# syntax as well as general programming techniques. As such, there are 
various identifiable limitations as explained in the 'Features and Limitations' section of
this README file.

Development time was 4 days - approximately 25 hours of learning enhancement and programming.



3...PROGRAMMING FEATURES and LIMITATIONS
----------------------------------------
Programming features of the game include:

* Arrays
* Instantiating array values
* Conditions
* While loop, for loop, foreach loop and nested loops
* Various other programming concepts and methods

Noteworthy limitations to the game include:

* Game words are all set at 10 characters (rendering the conditions in lines 87 - 113 as being,
  not required by the program to function - I opted to simplify the project for expediency as it
  is required for my acceptance into formal programming education).

* Game words are what is known as 'heterograms' (aka 'isograms' and 'non-pattern words') meaning 
  that no letter of the alphabet appears more than once. This development decision was taken as 
  the required programming would simply reflect programming capability which has already been 
  demonstrated in other parts of the project.

* Game does not have a 'Play Again' option. This feature was deemed too ineffective to meet the
  purpose of the game, again, as the skills for such programming had already been demonstrated
  elsewhere in the project.



4...REQUIREMENTS
----------------
Recommended Requirements:

* Visual Studio 2022
* Windows 10
* 1.8 GHz or faster 64-bit processor; Quad-core or better recommended. ARM processors are not 
  supported.
* 16 GB of RAM
* Hard disk space: if Visual Studio already installed - 100KB, if Visual Studio not already 
  installed - 1GB.
* Video Card with resolution capability of 1920 x 1080 or higher.



5...INSTALLATION
----------------
* Install Visual Studio 2022 (see 'REQUIREMENTS' header)
* Open Visual Studio
* Select 'Clone a repository'
* On the 'Enter a Git repository URL' screen, input the following:
  https://github.com/DavidMizzi/CSProjectHangman.git
* Click the 'Clone' button in the bottom right of the screen
* If you experience any issues accessing the program, please contact the developer whose details
  are found under the 'Developer Contact' header.



6...RUNNING the PROGRAM
