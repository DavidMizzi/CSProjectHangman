/* This program is my version of the cult classic game - hangman.
 * The program has been developed as an intial project prior to undertaking
 * the study of Cert IV Information Technology due to start in 2023.
 * 
 * The program utilises a number of basic programming concepts and its
 * primary development purpose is to support me to embed my C# learnings
 * over the past 4 weeks using the .NET framework.
 * 
 * The game difficulty level is static using the following method: 
 * number of characters in word + 4 chances = total chances.
 * 
 * Enjoy.
 * Signing off - David Mizzi 16.10.2022
